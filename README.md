# Green Energy stocks-analysis
Analyze green energy stocks performance (2017 and 2018) to help stockbrokers advise clients on which of the green energy stocks investments.

### Purpose
Steve's top clients (which happens to be his own parents) are passionate in investing on green energy and he wants to make sure they invest on the company with the best possible returns. Do do this, we collected all the 2017 and 2017 green energy stocks and began to analyze them for Steve.

### Analysis 
Afer we completed analyzing the data, we found:
1. The top five perfomers in 2017 were DQ, SEDG, ENPH, and FSLR.
2. In 2018, hower, only ENPH and RUN had a positive returns, the rest were all in the negatives.
3. TERP is a company that has not done well in both years

### Button and Execution Time
We created a clickable button and improved the execution time. 
1. The button allows Steve to just click and enter the year he wants to look 
2. By useing refactoring, we saved Steve from "click and wait." The data is executed within a second

### Summary - The advantage and disadvantage of refactoring code
#### The Advantages
1. Refactactoring code speed up the execution/run time
2. Utilizes the computer memory better
3. saves time - it took my first code (before refactoring) over 40 seconds to execute, it took only 0.66 seconds with my refactoring  code

#### Disadvantages
1. Difficult to understand for new students
